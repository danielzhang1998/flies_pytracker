# flies_pytracker
pytracker for the flies project

For UWA summer down under internship flies project

The main pyTracker files is not written by me, I just do some attribute to make it works better.

## to download the files:
Way 1:
Enter this to your browser:
https://github.com/danielzhang1998/flies_pytracker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Way 2:
Open your terminal or cmd

Go to the directory that you want to store these files

Enter:

git clone https://github.com/danielzhang1998/flies_pytracker.git


If the terminal/cmd said 'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.  (something like this), google how to install git on your machine
